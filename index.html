    <h2 id="cosplay">Cosplay</h2>
    <p>Cosplay (コスプレ kosupure), a contraction of the words costume and play, is a hobby in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character.
        Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture, and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. 
        Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. 
        Favorite sources include anime, cartoons, comic books, live-action films, television series and video games.</p>
