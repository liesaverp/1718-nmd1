    <h2 id="cosplay">Cosplay</h2>
    <p>Cosplay, or costume play, is what happens when a community meets creativity. Whether it's anime, videogames, movies or books, if you have a favourite, why not turn yourself into your favourite character?
        You could buy a costume, or, as I and thousands do, make one yourself. The sky is the limit then.
    </p>

    <p>I've been cosplaying for a few years now, and through this hobby I have acquired many new skills, from sewing to foamsmithing. I started with a cardboard spear! Every now and then, I even get to help out a friend with their costume.<br>
    Lately, even 3D-printing has been added to the mix. The applications are endless! Entire props can now be printed directly from in-game/3D-sculpted models, for maximum accuracy.</p>
